### About me
---
Hi, I am 23 years old and I have big ambitions in the field of Front-End. At the moment I am taking programming courses and I have success in this. From childhood I liked computers and their devices, but I was more interested in how certain programs work. As a child, I tried to write plugins for games according to guides, but that was a long time ago. Now I want to monetize and develop my interest in IT. I am very interested in developing in this area and I will do my best not to stand still. Thank you for your attention.

> Write a program that prints numbers to the console in ascending order in a range,
designated by the user with prompt.
```
const num1 = prompt(`Enter the first number in the range`);
const num2 = prompt(`Enter the second number of the range`);

if (+num2 - +num1 >= 5 || +num1 - +num2 >= 5) {
  if (+num1 < +num2) {
    for (let i = +num1; i <= +num2; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  } else if (+num1 > +num2) {
    for (let i = +num1; i >= num2; i--) {
